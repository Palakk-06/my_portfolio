Bike Sharing Demand Analysis Project
Overview
This project delves into a bike-sharing dataset to analyze factors influencing rental demand. The goal is to provide actionable insights for a bike-sharing company to optimize its operations, predict future demand, and identify potential areas for growth. This analysis utilizes a combination of data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization techniques.

Problem Statement
A bike-sharing company aims to understand the various factors affecting bike rental demand. By gaining a deeper insight into these drivers, the company can optimize its operational strategies, accurately predict future demand, and identify untapped opportunities for expansion and service improvement.

Analysis Details
To answer the guided questions, the project will involve the following analytical steps:

Time-Series Analysis: Rental data will be aggregated and visualized over various time granularities (daily, monthly, yearly) to identify overall trends, seasonality, and long-term patterns.

Categorical Analysis: Bike rental counts will be analyzed against categorical variables like day of the week, season, and holiday status using aggregation and comparative visualizations (e.g., bar charts, box plots).

Correlation and Regression (Exploratory): Relationships between continuous weather variables (temperature, humidity, windspeed) and bike rental demand will be explored using scatter plots and correlation coefficients. This will help understand the degree and nature of their impact.

User Segment Comparison: Rental patterns of casual versus registered users will be compared using aggregated statistics and visualizations to highlight behavioral differences and preferences.

Comparative Analysis: Specific comparisons will be made for rental counts on holidays versus working days, and trends will be explicitly compared across different years within the dataset.

Data-driven Insights: All findings will be synthesized into actionable insights and recommendations for the bike-sharing company's operations, marketing, and expansion strategies.
